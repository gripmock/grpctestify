## Installation

### Using Homebrew (macOS/Linux)
```bash
# Tap the repository
brew tap gripmock/tap

# Install grpctestify
brew install grpctestify

# Verify installation
grpctestify --version
```

### Manual Installation (Dependencies)
1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   # macOS
   brew install grpcurl jq

   # Ubuntu/Debian
   sudo apt install -y grpcurl jq

   # Verify installation
   grpcurl --version
   jq --version
   ```

2. **Download the Script**:
   Use `curl` or `wget` to download the `grpctestify.sh` script from the latest release:
   ```bash
   # Using curl
   curl -LO https://github.com/gripmock/grpctestify/releases/latest/download/grpctestify.sh

   # Using wget
   wget https://github.com/gripmock/grpctestify/releases/latest/download/grpctestify.sh
   ```

3. **Make the Script Executable**:
   After downloading, make the script executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x grpctestify.sh
   ```

4. **Move the Script to a Directory in Your PATH**:
   Optionally, move the script to a directory in your `PATH` for easier access:
   ```bash
   sudo mv grpctestify.sh /usr/local/bin/grpctestify
   ```

5. **Verify Installation**:
   Check that the script is working correctly:
   ```bash
   grpctestify --version
   ```

## Usage
```bash
# Single test file
./grpctestify.sh test_case.gctf

# Directory mode (recursive)
./grpctestify.sh tests/

# Verbose output mode
./grpctestify.sh --verbose tests/

# Disable colors
./grpctestify.sh --no-color test_case.gctf

# Check for updates
./grpctestify.sh --update

# Show version
./grpctestify.sh --version
```

## Test File Format (`.gctf`)
```php
--- ADDRESS ---
localhost:50051

--- ENDPOINT ---
package.service/Method

--- REQUEST ---
{
  "key": "value"
}

--- RESPONSE ---
{
  "status": "OK"
}
```

## Streaming Examples üåä

### Client Streaming
Multiple REQUEST blocks followed by a single RESPONSE
```php
--- ADDRESS ---
localhost:50051

--- ENDPOINT ---
chat.ChatService/SendMessages

--- REQUEST ---
{ "name": "hello" }

--- REQUEST ---
{ "name": "world" }

--- REQUEST ---
{ "name": "from" }

--- REQUEST ---
{ "name": "grpctestify" }

--- RESPONSE ---
{ "message": "hello world from grpctestify" }
```

### Server Streaming
Single REQUEST followed by multiple RESPONSE blocks
```php
--- ADDRESS ---
localhost:50051

--- ENDPOINT ---
news.NewsService/Subscribe

--- REQUEST ---
{ "message": "hello world from grpctestify" }

--- RESPONSE ---
{ "name": "hello" }

--- RESPONSE ---
{ "name": "world" }

--- RESPONSE ---
{ "name": "from" }

--- RESPONSE ---
{ "name": "grpctestify" }
```

### Bidirectional Streaming
Alternating REQUEST and RESPONSE blocks
```php
--- ADDRESS ---
localhost:50051

--- ENDPOINT ---
math.Calculator/SumStream

--- REQUEST ---
{ "value": 2 }

--- RESPONSE ---
{ "sum": 2 }

--- REQUEST ---
{ "value": 1 }

--- RESPONSE ---
{ "sum": 3 }

--- REQUEST ---
{ "value": 0 }

--- RESPONSE ---
{ "sum": 3 }
```
