## üéØ Test Scenarios

### Secure File Upload
Encrypted file upload with access control:

```gctf
--- ADDRESS ---
localhost:4770

--- TLS ---
ca_cert: ./../server/tls/ca-cert.pem
cert: ./../server/tls/client-cert.pem
key: ./../server/tls/client-key.pem
server_name: localhost

--- ENDPOINT ---
storage.SecureFileService/UploadFile

--- REQUEST ---
{
    "filename": "sensitive_document.pdf",
    "file_data": "SGVsbG8gV29ybGQh",
    "encryption_type": "AES256",
    "access_level": "confidential",
    "user_id": "user_123"
}

--- RESPONSE ---
{
    "file": {
        "id": "file_001",
        "filename": "sensitive_document.pdf",
        "encrypted": true,
        "encryption_type": "AES256",
        "access_level": "confidential",
        "upload_status": "completed",
        "checksum": "sha256:abc123...",
        "uploaded_at": "2024-01-01T12:00:00Z"
    },
    "success": true
}

--- ASSERTS ---
.file.encrypted == true
.file.encryption_type == "AES256"
.file.access_level == "confidential"
.file.checksum | test("sha256:")
.success == true
```

### File Access Control
Secure file access with permissions:

```gctf
--- ADDRESS ---
localhost:4770

--- TLS ---
ca_cert: ./../server/tls/ca-cert.pem
cert: ./../server/tls/client-cert.pem
key: ./../server/tls/client-key.pem
server_name: localhost

--- ENDPOINT ---
storage.SecureFileService/GetFile

--- REQUEST ---
{
    "file_id": "file_001",
    "user_id": "user_123",
    "access_token": "valid-token-12345"
}

--- RESPONSE ---
{
    "file": {
        "id": "file_001",
        "filename": "sensitive_document.pdf",
        "content": "decrypted_content_here",
        "access_granted": true,
        "access_level": "confidential",
        "accessed_at": "2024-01-01T12:05:00Z"
    },
    "success": true
}

--- ASSERTS ---
.file.access_granted == true
.file.access_level == "confidential"
.file.content | type == "string"
.success == true
```

### Access Denied Scenario
Testing access control failures:

```gctf
--- ADDRESS ---
localhost:4770

--- TLS ---
ca_cert: ./../server/tls/ca-cert.pem
cert: ./../server/tls/client-cert.pem
key: ./../server/tls/client-key.pem
server_name: localhost

--- ENDPOINT ---
storage.SecureFileService/GetFile

--- REQUEST ---
{
    "file_id": "file_001",
    "user_id": "user_456",
    "access_token": "invalid-token"
}

--- ERROR ---
{
    "code": 7,
    "message": "Access denied: insufficient permissions",
    "details": [
        {
            "type": "permission_error",
            "reason": "user_456 does not have access to confidential files"
        }
    ]
}

--- ASSERTS ---
.code == 7
.message | contains("Access denied")
.details[0].type == "permission_error"
```

### File Encryption Verification
Verify file encryption status:

```gctf
--- ADDRESS ---
localhost:4770

--- TLS ---
ca_cert: ./../server/tls/ca-cert.pem
cert: ./../server/tls/client-cert.pem
key: ./../server/tls/client-key.pem
server_name: localhost

--- ENDPOINT ---
storage.SecureFileService/VerifyEncryption

--- REQUEST ---
{
    "file_id": "file_001",
    "user_id": "user_123"
}

--- RESPONSE ---
{
    "verification": {
        "file_id": "file_001",
        "encrypted": true,
        "encryption_type": "AES256",
        "key_rotation_date": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
        "integrity_check": "passed",
        "verified_at": "2024-01-01T12:10:00Z"
    },
    "success": true
}

--- ASSERTS ---
.verification.encrypted == true
.verification.integrity_check == "passed"
.verification.encryption_type == "AES256"
