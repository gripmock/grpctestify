## üöÄ Quick Start Examples

### Basic Unary RPC
```gctf
--- ADDRESS ---
localhost:4770

--- ENDPOINT ---
user.UserService/GetUser

--- REQUEST ---
{
  "user_id": "123"
}

--- RESPONSE ---
{
  "user_id": "123", 
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john@example.com"
}
```

### With Assertions
```gctf
--- ADDRESS ---
localhost:4770

--- ENDPOINT ---
user.UserService/CreateUser

--- REQUEST ---
{
  "name": "Jane Doe",
  "email": "jane@example.com"
}

--- RESPONSE ---
{
  "user_id": "456",
  "name": "Jane Doe", 
  "email": "jane@example.com",
  "created_at": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z"
}

--- ASSERTS ---
.user_id | tonumber > 0
.created_at | strptime("%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ") | type == "array"
.email | test("@")
```

### Error Handling
```gctf
--- ADDRESS ---
localhost:4770

--- ENDPOINT ---
user.UserService/GetUser

--- REQUEST ---
{
  "user_id": "nonexistent"
}

--- ERROR ---
{
  "code": "NOT_FOUND",
  "message": "User not found"
}

--- ASSERTS ---
.code == "NOT_FOUND"
.message | contains("not found")
```

### TLS Authentication
```gctf
--- ADDRESS ---
localhost:4770

--- TLS ---
ca_cert: ./../server/tls/ca-cert.pem
cert: ./../server/tls/client-cert.pem
key: ./../server/tls/client-key.pem
server_name: localhost

--- ENDPOINT ---
user.UserService/AuthenticateUser

--- REQUEST ---
{
  "username": "alice",
  "password": "password123"
}

--- RESPONSE ---
{
  "user": {
    "id": "*",
    "username": "alice",
    "role": "admin"
  },
  "token": "*",
  "success": true
}
```

### Client Streaming
```gctf
--- ADDRESS ---
localhost:4770

--- ENDPOINT ---
storage.FileService/UploadFile

--- REQUEST ---
{
  "file_id": "file_001",
  "chunk_number": 1,
  "data": "SGVsbG8gV29ybGQh",
  "is_last": false
}

--- REQUEST ---
{
  "file_id": "file_001", 
  "chunk_number": 2,
  "data": "RmluYWwgY2h1bms=",
  "is_last": true
}

--- RESPONSE ---
{
  "file_id": "file_001",
  "total_chunks": 2,
  "success": true
}
```
